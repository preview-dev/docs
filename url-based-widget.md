# URL based Preview Widget

## Summary
In addition to our current product based preview widget, URL based widget adds the ability to enable a playlist in non-product pages. Any page can embed the widget with a fully customizable playlist.

## URL widget

URL based widget is organised per site. Different sites can have different URLs. A URL can be created under site page:

Then you can create a URL resource as below:

Once the URL is saved successfully, you should be able to see the URL details page as below:

The next step is configure the playlist for it. There are two kinds of URL based playlist:

1. Products Group playlist
2. Customizable dedicated playlist dedicated for the widget

###  Products Group Playlist

For this playlist, the URL should be configured to be associated with multiple products. The playlist of the URL is an aggregation of all productsâ€™ linked videos (sampled by top 5 randomly).

You can search the products and link the product to the URL directly in the above page.

Alternatively, you can go to product details page:

Then choose the target URL you would like to link:

### Dedicated Playlist

URL based playlist can be fully customised. It could be done via a concept called Virtual Product. You can create a Virtual Product and draft a playlist for it. Then link the virtual product solely to the target URL.

## Website Configuration

Choose a page and/or location for the playlist
Similar to the product specific playlist, a script as below should be placed in the target location

```html
<div class="previewUrl" />
```

Then add widget via the below code piece:
```html
(function (w,d,s,o,f,js,fjs) {
		w[o] = w[o] || function () { (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments) };
        js = d.createElement(s), fjs = d.querySelector('.'+o);
        js.id = o; js.src = f; js.async = 1; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
    }(window, document, 'script', 'previewUrl', 'https://widget.preview.io/preview.js'));

previewUrl('url', {mode: "section"});
```
