## Plan

Currently, we offer two types of plans: Free and Premium.

The Free plan provides access to the majority of features but has certain limitations. With this plan, you can manage up to 20 products and a single website.

On the other hand, the Premium plan unlocks all advanced features and grants you the ability to manage one website with unlimited products. Additionally, you also receive a development site where you can work with up to 10 products.

In addition to these standard plans, we provide customized options that can be tailored specifically to your needs. Whether you require support for multiple websites or desire a special widget mode exclusively for your site, we are here to assist you. Don't hesitate to reach out to us directly to discuss your requirements.
